# Project: Voluble - Chat App
# Version: 1.00

# Important Notes: 
- See branch V-1-0-0 for the source code files, the APK file, and the test phone numbers that can be used to test out the application!
- You may be unable to use your actual phone number, so I recommend using the test numbers since I am using Google's free Firebase I am limited to 10 free SMS messages a day and its just safer for your data to use the test numbers! (If I can add more numbers I can without any issues I will!)


# Description:
This is a chat application made in Java and the backend Firebase!
This project has provided me with basic knowledge on how to structure an Android app, effectively use Firebase as a backend, and develop a functional and useful application.
It includes features like real-time messaging and user authentication!
Below are some of the programming skills that this project has helped me practice!

# Practiced Skills:
- Java Development
- Android Development
- Application Development
- Front/Back-End Development
- UI/UX Design
- Firebase, Firestore, Realtime Databases
- Android Studio
- Github
- Error/Debugging Skills

I followed a great tutorial from @Easy Tuto!
https://www.youtube.com/@EasyTuto1

Although only a year old, Android Studio has changed a lot since then, but his tutorial is still a great reference!
In addition, since certain features were deprecated, it allowed me to practice work arounds and my problem solving skills!
